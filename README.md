# MAGD-150-Assignments

**_Lab 2_** consists of a p5.js file, a sketch file, and an index page to view the project. The code in sketch.js leads to a purple display with various shapes and lines.
**_Lab 3_** consists of a p5.js file, sketch.js file, and index page. The index, in response to sketch.js code, has a purple background with frame/second count in the corner. When user mouse goes across the screen, a gray oval appears. 
**_Lab 4_** consists of a p5.js file, sketch.js file, and index page. There is an orange background on the index page, with a pizza-like image. When the mouse is clicked, a gray circle appears and goes behind the pizza.
**_Lab 6_** consists of a p5.js file, sketch.js file, and an index page. There is a black background with a Pac-woman in the corner. When the start button above her is clicked, white dots appear as if it were a still image of the game. There is a green circle and some blue triangles, appearing as the Pac ghosts.
**_Lab 7_** consists of a p5.js file, sketch.js file, and an index page. This is one of my personal favorite assignments. There is a gray background, with two basic shape trees. A second after the index page is opened, blue dots appear as pouring rain.
